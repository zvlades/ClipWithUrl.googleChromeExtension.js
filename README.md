# ClipWithURL
Google Chrome Browser extension

##What does it do
Copies any text on a web-page **with web-page URL and time stamp** directly to clipboard.

## Example
After selecting "ClipWithURL" on this page and hitting the shortcut (default is `Alt+C`), you can paste the text to any place you want. Here is how it should look like:
```
ClipWithURL  
    [10/15/2016 3:12 AM], source: <https://github.com/jvlad/ClipWithUrl.googleChromeExtension.js>
```

Timestamp, of source, is composed at the moment you are actually pressing `Alt+C`.  
"source" contains what you see at your browser's address bar at the moment of pressing the shortcut.

Here is how it looks like after markdown processing:
